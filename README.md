# SuperHero-App
Heroes Vs Villains

Group project

Simple application that pulls heroes' and villains' stats from an api and displays then side by side. Also displays what movies each character
has been in.

I worked mainly on the styling of the page and coded pulling stats from the api for each character.
Michael, Chris, David, and Ollie worked on a lot of the back end coding.
